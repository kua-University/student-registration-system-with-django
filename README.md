# Student Payment System

This is a Django-based web application for managing student payments. It allows students to register their name, course, and payment value, and integrates with Stripe for payment processing. The project includes comprehensive testing for models, forms, URLs, and Stripe integration, as well as system testing.

## Features

- **Student Registration**: Students can register their name, course, and payment value.
- **Stripe Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing using Stripe.
- **Payment Tracking**: Track payments made by students.
- **Testing**: Includes component testing, integration testing, and system testing using `pytest`.
- **Simple Frontend**: Built with HTML for a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe
- **Database**: SQLite (default for Django, can be changed to PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- **Testing Framework**: `pytest`, `pytest-django`

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Django 4.x
- Stripe Python Library (`stripe`)
- `pytest` and `pytest-django` for testing
- A Stripe account (for API keys)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-payment-system.git
   cd student-payment-system
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Stripe API Keys**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Stripe API keys:

     ```plaintext
     STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
     ```

5. **Run Migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a Superuser (Admin)**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing using `pytest`:

### 1. **Component Testing**
   - **Models**: Tests for the `Student` and `Payment` models in `test_models.py`.
   - **Forms**: Tests for the student registration form in `test_forms.py`.
   - **URLs**: Tests for URL routing in `test_urls.py`.

   Run component tests with:
   ```bash
   pytest payment/tests/test_models.py
   pytest payment/tests/test_forms.py
   pytest payment/tests/test_urls.py
   ```

### 2. **Integration Testing**
   - **Views and Stripe**: Tests for the payment process, including Stripe integration, in `test_views.py`.

   Run integration tests with:
   ```bash
   pytest payment/tests/test_views.py
   ```

### 3. **System Testing**
   - **End-to-End Testing**: Tests the entire system, including user registration, payment, and database updates, in `test_system.py`.

   Run system tests with:
   ```bash
   pytest payment/tests/test_system.py
   ```

### Running All Tests
To run all tests at once:
```bash
pytest
```

## Usage

1. **Student Registration**
   - Navigate to the homepage.
   - Fill in the student's name, course, and payment value.
   - Click "Register" to save the details.

2. **Make a Payment**
   - After registration, click "Pay Now" to proceed to the Stripe payment page.
   - Enter payment details and complete the transaction.

3. **Admin Panel**
   - Access the Django admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.
   - Use the superuser credentials to log in and manage student records and payments.

## Stripe Integration

- The project uses Stripe's `Checkout` API for payment processing.
- Ensure you have set up your Stripe account and added the API keys to the `.env` file.
- Test payments can be made using Stripe's test card number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`.
